# Fail the build if the DEFAULT jar-with-dependencies does not carry exactly the
# cross-platform Netty natives it should - every platform's tcnative and epoll, and
# NO QUIC natives.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# This is the third half of the guard split by the HTTP/3 classifier work.
# assert-slim-jar-natives.sh guards the two single-arch slim jars; assert-http3-jar-natives.sh
# guards that the http3 classifier really carries the QUIC natives. Nothing guarded the
# DEFAULT jar-with-dependencies - the most-downloaded artifact and the one the Dockerfiles'
# `source=download` path fetches - even though it is subject to the same two silent failures:
#
#   * A netty rename, or an edit to the dependency tree, could drop a platform's tcnative or
#     epoll native. Maven's assembly plugin does NOT fail when an unpack set matches nothing,
#     so the jar would still build, install and start; on the affected platform tcnative would
#     fall back to the JDK SSL provider and epoll to NIO - silently.
#   * The default descriptor EXCLUDES "META-INF/native/*quiche*" because HTTP/3 ships in the
#     separate `-jar-with-dependencies-http3` classifier. If that exclude were dropped, the
#     default jar would silently regain the ~11 MiB of QUIC natives the split exists to remove.
#     quiche's ABSENCE is therefore an invariant to ENFORCE, not a regression to catch - the
#     same invariant assert-slim-jar-natives.sh enforces on the slim jars.
#
# The expected set is spelled out rather than counted so that a DROPPED platform is NAMED in
# the failure, not just totalled - exactly as assert-http3-jar-natives.sh spells out the QUIC
# platforms. epoll is Linux-only (two arches); tcnative ships for all five platforms. Note the
# epoll library is libnetty_transport_native_epoll_<arch>.so with NO "linux_" in its name.
